I met Andrea over a year ago, he bought my <a href="http://www.imxprs.com/free/ritchbits/6-figure-richard-legg-webinar-landing">Ultimate Blueprint To Start a Web Agency</a>, and he’s really been growing his business. Most Americans get caught up in silly little things that don’t make a difference, we’re spoiled here in the US. What I really admire about Andrea is his drive, and persistence in gaining market share in his home country, Italy. If he can grow a booming business in Italy, why can’t you do the same in the USA or wherever you’re from?</p><p><b></b></p><p>I’ve been wanting him to do a guest post for a while now, especially since he’s using a technique that could really boost conversions for those using my Ice Cold Email Gold strategy. He’s been getting a 2% lead rate from cold emails and 30% conversions of those leads.</p><p><b></b></p><p>So let’s get into it.</p><p><b></b></p><p>BOOST YOUR COLD EMAIL CONVERSIONS</p><p><b></b></p><p>Every reader in this awesome blog probably knows the importance of positioning yourself as an expert, so what if I told you that there’s a way to let them increase the perceived value of your service by not even directly talking to them?</p><p><b></b></p><p>Seems crazy right?</p><p><b></b></p><p>Well, that’s what I’ve done for the past months and that’s how I’m currently generating 60-70% of my clients.</p><p><b></b></p><p>It all starts with an email like this :</p><p><b></b></p><p>“Good Morning,</p><p>I’m (your name here), the owner of a Web Agency in CITIYNAME.</p><p><b></b></p><p>We have visited your website and we have noticed that your online visibility could be improved considerably, so you can attract more customers using internet.</p><p><b></b></p><p>If you want, we can prepare you a free of charge video where we’ll provide you free advice of strategies that you can use to acquire more customers (in your specific case).</p><p><b></b></p><p>Could you be interested?</p><p><b></b></p><p>Thank you in advance,</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>(first name and last name here),</p><p>(telephone number)</p><p>(our web agency website)</p><p>(our email)”</p><p><b></b></p><p>That’s basically the standard script we use.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Now…out of 100 emails sent with this content you’ll probably receive something like 2-3 “yes” and those are the ones we’ll focus on.</p><p><b></b></p><p>For each one of the “yes I want the video” we’ll prepare a “customized” video where we’ll explain them what they can do to improve their online visibility so we can better position ourselves as the expert.</p><p><b></b></p><p>While making the video remember that the business owner probably don’t know any of the technical terms we use to identify marketing strategies (such as CRO, Responsive, etc.) so we’ll have to remember to explain everything in details and use an easy language while talking.</p><p><b></b></p><p>HOW I USED VIDEOS TO GENERATE LEADS</p><p><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s75D4yQ_7-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p><b></b></p><p>6-7 months ago, when I first started using this strategy, I was making the whole video manually.</p><p><b></b></p><p>So I installed Camtasia Recorder and gone over after the whole 15-18 minutes video.</p><p><b></b></p><p>I keep myself under 20 minutes because otherwise it would be too long to be watched by a business owner (remember that business owner don’t have much time during the day, just like us).</p><p><b></b></p><p>It was still working fine but I didn’t know where this was heading because I didn’t see it as a scalable strategy, even though I was generating good profits out of it.</p><p><b></b></p><p>So after a few talks with Nathan (which, by the way, I highly recommend his mentoring / coaching) he suggested me that I definitely should let this video be created in a faster way (I was spending about 30-40 minutes for each video to be made, because it’s not just recording but also editing, producing it and uploading on Youtube) so I worked out and start thinking day and night about how and what can I do to automatize and scale the unscalable while still keeping the “custom” video idea.</p><p><b></b></p><p><a href="http://www.imxprs.com/free/ritchbits/ultimate-agency-blueprint">Never miss an opportunity to grow your knowledge and skill set, join over 1,000 other people making money using this information by entering your email here</a></p><p><b></b></p><p>MY PROCESS FOR USING VIDEOS TO BRING IN REVENUE</p><p><b></b></p><p>Let’s start with talking how I usually make a video for a lead.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Remember that it’s VERY important to have your face with you talking in the bottom right corner of the screen (so turn on that camera and don’t be shy because it will give them much more trust in you).</p><p><b></b></p><p>This screen below basically shows up how a standard video is made by us :</p><p><b></b></p><picture>

<p>1- This is the introduction part.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Here you’ll tell the lead who you are, what’s the goal of this video and why you have made it. (You can also tell them that you made this video because you are really confident that these things will work and you have no problems in showing your expertise so you’ll gave out to them some real value in return of a possible partnership).</p><p><b></b></p><p>2- As soon as you finish the introduction, you’ll head over their website and:</p><p><b></b></p><p>Case A- If it is not mobile compatible / responsive, you’ll explain them that this is a huge problem (since 53% of the traffic on internet is coming out from mobile devices).</p><p><b></b></p><p>Case B- If they don’t have a good CRO, you’ll explain them what they could do to improve their CRO and how this will benefit them. I usually always take as example for this the notion about where their phone number should be placed and why it should be placed in a particular area of the website (in example, top right area).</p><p><b></b></p><p>3- In this part of the video you have to act like a customer and try to find their business on Google. </p><p><b></b></p><p>So you’ll say “Ok, now, let’s suppose I’m a possible customer of your company, so I need a “roofing company in Dallas, TX” “ (roofing it’s just an example).</p><p><b></b></p><p>After you said that you’ll hang over Google and check where they are with them. If they are in the top results in the first page you’ll hang over this link (<a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-organic-click-through-rates-in-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moz.com/blog/google-organic-click-through-rates-in-2014</a>  on the CTR study part) and show them what would mean to be in the first places of the first page of Google.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Otherwise, if they are not in the first places of the first page you’ll just explain them that it is important to be in the first places and that you can help them out.</p><p><b></b></p><p>4- Explain The Importance of Solid Rankings</p><p><b></b></p><p>So, in this part, you’ll basically head over Keyword planner, and show them what is the volume of the keywords searched relevant to their industry in their city.</p><p><b></b></p><p>After you got their attention you get back on the Google results page and explain them what are the 2 main strategies to show up in Google in the first places.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Strategy A: (which is the one they can do too) : Google Adwords. Explain them what would it mean to have a “yellow colored ad” and how will they pay. (try to sell Smart PPC Management here)</p><p><b></b></p><p>Strategy B: SEO. Tell them that this is a much more interesting strategy and will benefit them more in the long term.</p><p><b></b></p><p>5- Show The Potential of Facebook Ads</p><p><b></b></p><p>After you have showed how powerful Google can be you go on Facebook and show them what facebook ads are (with a real example of ads showing on your own facebook wall) and why setting up a campaign could probably benefit them (try to sell them smart ppc management here too).</p><p><b></b></p><p>6- Show the Potential of Facebook Groups for Marketing</p><p><b></b></p><p>This is a strategy where I always show them as a “secondary strategy”, in order to not create false hope in the customer who could probably try this on their own.</p><p><b></b></p><p>This strategy consists basically in heading over local facebook groups and trying to promote their business by posting on it. It sometimes work it sometimes doesn’t, it also depends on what kind of post they make, their industry, the time they post and so on.</p><p><b></b></p><p>7- Conclusion To The Video</p><p><b></b></p><p>You thank them for watching the whole video and tell them that there were many more things that could be done to actually improve their online visibility. Explain them that if they liked the video and would like to estabilish a deeper partnership, they don’t have to hesitate to contact you.</p><p><b></b></p><p>AUTOMATING THE PROCESS</p><p><b></b></p><p>Alright, so now that we have looked in details what are the main parts of a standard video production, let’s get into the automatization part.</p><p><b></b></p><p>So how did I make the video automatic while still have a “custom style”?</p><p><b></b></p><p>Simple. I split it in pieces and attached screenshots and short pieces of videos to it.</p><p><b></b></p><picture>

<p><b></b></p><p>1 – In this part you don’t have to do anything other than repeat the same introduction for all your leads. You can just keep the same camera and voice recording for all your videos while having as background screen the screenshots of their email answer (they will never notice it’s a screenshot and not you recording your screen).</p><p><b></b></p><p>2- Create 2 speeches for case A or B and then record a really short video of you moving up and down on their website (without camera). Then attach the screen recording to the camera and audio recording so you have yourself talking about how bad not having a mobile website is while they see you going up and down on their website. You also want to loop that short video (so copy and paste) a few times, until you reach the next recording chapter (so you’ll have to fill the parts of the recording where there is nothing except your camera recording).</p><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><picture>

<p>While talking about mobile I usually always show also an example of a website which has mobile responsiveness.</p><p>While talking about CRO I usually also show them a website which has a good CRO in my opinion.</p><p><b></b></p><p>With these 2 examples it’s much easier for me to have an semi-automatic video (the unique manually done part in this section 2 is just recording a short piece of video on their website where you basically scroll up and down just to show them that it’s live recorded).</p><p><b></b></p><p>3- Here I put the screenshot of the homepage of Google and then when I say their niche I switch the screenshot to the results page of their industry keyword searched on Google.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Manual parts here will be attaching the screenshot of Google, screenshot of the result page and saying “…roofing company in Dallas….” In the sentence “let’s suppose I am a potential customer for your business so I’m looking for a ….”</p><p><b></b></p><p>4- This section is made up by 3 parts.</p><p>First part of the video will show myself going on Google and searching “keyword planner” (this should be a pre-recorded part so it’s not manual), the second part will have the screenshot with the keyword filled in and searched in keyword planner (I’ll also say with my voice the volume of the keyword loudly here, to catch their attention on how big the number is) and the third part will have me talking upon the Google result page screenshot and explain how would they rank.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Notice that the CTR SERP search part would go in this section between 2nd and 3rd part of this piece of video.</p><p><b></b></p><p>5- Completely automate part where I basically show them a general facebook ad and the things they need to know to create a campaign.</p><p><b></b></p><p>6- Completely automatic part where I show them a general local facebook group and show them how to post on it.</p><p><b></b></p><p>7- Almost completely automatic part where I conclude the video with a screenshot on it showing their answer sent via email.</p><p><b></b></p><p>And that’s all!</p><p><b></b></p><p>Doing all these optimization I’ve been able to take a 30 minutes task to 3-5 minutes.</p><p><b></b></p><p>With the automation implemented, the video creation will become more a copy and paste of screenshots and pieces of video rather than an actual video recording, even tough they will still think it’s completely customized for them.</p><p><b></b></p><p>The next step for me is hiring a VA which would take care of editing these last easy automatized piece of videos for me so I would only have to record two 10 seconds voice recordings in each video in order to make it ready to go.</p><p><b></b></p><p>EDIT: Bonus Material: Example Video</p><p><iframe width="600" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nNDRued3GWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hope you enjoyed this guide.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="67"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="68"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="69"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="70"><span data-reactid="71"><!-- react-empty: 72 --><h2 data-reactid="73"><a data-reactid="74">Income Boss</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="75"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="76"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="77"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="78"></div></section></div></div>
