IT’S MUCH EASIER TO MAKE MONEY WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY</h3><p>It seems pretty basic.</p><p>It seems obvious.</p><p>Why is it that half the people wanting to get started in this field are broke? They have no money to invest in their business, they have no money to invest in themselves.</p><p>If you can’t afford your own web hosting or a domain name then you’re in trouble.</p><p>If you can’t afford a phone line so you can cold call or simply accept calls from clients, then you’re setting yourself up for failure.</p><p>Most people can not start something from nothing. It’s just not likely to happen. The few people that CAN, still end up failing. Does that seem like a logical risk to take?</p><p>I actually was one of those people that started with pretty much nothing. Leeching wifi from a business nearby. It’s not fun and it’s extremely difficult to be able to make money when you have nothing to invest.</p><p>The best advice I can give you, is get a job. Have a little bit of money saved up so you can afford to start things the right way. It’s so much easier to make money when you already have money.</p><p>Money, isn’t the end goal. Money is just a very important tool. Building a business without it is like trying to build a house from the ground up, using a steak knife to cut wood and a rock to pound nails in… instead of a hammer.</p><p><strong>You want to succeed? Don’t work for money… make your money work for you.</strong></p><h3>2.) YOU NEED A FREAKIN PLAN!</h3><p>Just wanting to do something, isn’t enough.</p><p>Do you have a business plan? A marketing plan? Do you have benchmarks setup so you can put money aside for future expenses in order to grow your business?</p><p>Do you have outsourcers lined up? Project management platform?</p><p>Do you know who your ideal customer is?</p><p>Do you know what your pricing strategy is or are you just going to “custom quote” everything?</p><p>These are all things you should have covered. You should have every aspect of your business, planned out ahead of time. Remember, this isn’t just money you’re investing but your time. Don’t you want to make the most of your investment?</p><p>Before you decide to get into this, set some time aside to really come up with a plan.</p><h3>3.) JUST DO IT!</h3><p>Making your money work for you, having an actual plan you can execute… neither one of these things really make much of a difference if you’re the type to just sit back and look for excuses to why you’re not putting things into motion.</p><p>“Take action”, is what most people say to do, and you’ll be fine. Not exactly the truth though is it? However, when you have an actual plan then you can take highly focused action, which is what matters.</p><p>Are you worried about calling someone and interrupting their day? Just do it… Thinking about when you should start your own blog, just do it and then figure out a launch date.</p><p>People get hung up on stupid stuff. I’m no exception and I’m sure you aren’t either.</p><p>There comes a point when the planning phase is done. Don’t procrastinate by adding unnecessary things to your plan, just get started implementing it!</p><p><em><strong><a href="http://www.imxprs.com/free/ritchbits/ultimate-agency-blueprint">You want more tips?

<p>I frequently read articles about SEO tools and the majority of them suck.</p><p>Usually, the author was trying to put together a comprehensive list, but isn’t representative of the tools that the author actually uses.</p><p>I do SEO all day, erry’day, and these are the free tools I actually use…</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><em>This is part #1 of a multipart series.</em></p><h2><u>Tools for Keyword Research</u></h2><h3><a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner">Google Keyword Planner</a></h3><p>Okay, this one may seem obvious, but it’s the basis of pretty much all keyword research.</p><p>Most of the other tools will require that you extract search volume from Google Keyword Planner, even if you aren’t using it for keyword ideas.</p><h3><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a></h3><p>Another obvious one is Google Trends.</p><p>It will allow you quickly assess the future of the keywords you’re using and draw comparisons. You want that trend-line going up!</p><p>Another neat use-case for Google Trends is to understand difference in search trends between Web Search, Image Search, YouTube (as well as YouTube keyword research), News Search, and<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ebay-assistant/mnlcjfoeahfpaljmjkaedodllgghejgb">Shopping</a>Search.</p><p>Google Trends is also pretty useful for understanding any changes in search behavior. For example if the website that you’re doing SEO for just ran a giant television advertising campaign last month, you’re likely to see a spike.</p><h3><a href="http://keywordtool.io/">KeywordTool.io</a></h3><p>This tool is a bit of a replacement (or addition depending on how you use it) to the classic<a href="http://ubersuggest.org/">Ubersuggest</a>, a stable of SEO keyword research tools. <a href="http://KeywordTool.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeywordTool.io</a>, like Ubersuggest, collects keywords from autosuggest:</p><p>Ubersuggest will give you autocomple suggestions based on language and region for Web, Images, News,<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ebay-assistant/mnlcjfoeahfpaljmjkaedodllgghejgb">Shopping</a>, Video, and Recipes from Google.</p><p><a href="http://KeywordTool.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeywordTool.io</a> similarly will allow you to select language, region, and video (YouTube tab), like Ubersuggest. It also will provide suggestions from Bing and from the Apple AppStore.</p><h3><a href="http://tagcrowd.com/">TagCrowd</a></h3><p>Sometimes I need to make a word cloud to visualize keywords. My preference for this is TagCrowd. It’s simple, does what I need, and displays frequencies.</p><h3><a href="http://suggester.promediacorp.com/">Promediacorp’s free Google Suggest keyword research tool</a></h3><p>Another Google autosuggestion tools I sometimes use is the tool created by agency, Promediacorp. I’m not sure how its methodology differs from Ubersuggest or <a href="http://KeywordTool.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeywordTool.io</a>, but I like the results it gives and I use it in addition.</p><p>In addition to its good results, it ranks suggestions by order of appearance, allows to export to CSV, and attempts to do a sentiment analysis on the queries.</p><h3><a href="http://searchwilderness.com/bing-keyword-research/">Bing Ads Intelligence</a>(<a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/bing-ads-intelligence">Direct Tool Page</a>)</h3><p>Bing Ads Intelligence, like many keyword research tools, is meant to be used for Paid Search, but can be used for SEO.</p><p>It gives some pretty powerful keyword research power right within Excel, and if you’re like me, you’re in Excel A LOT.</p><p>I’ve written an<a href="http://searchwilderness.com/bing-keyword-research/">extensive guide for using Bing Ads Intelligence for Keyword Research</a>. I recommend checking it out.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>I use functionality provided within Bing Ads Intelligence that allows you to multiply keywords together. This can also be done within the Google Keyword Planner or with<a href="http://mergewords.com/">Merge Words</a>. If you don’t end up using Bing Ads Intelligence, use Merge Words.</p><h3><a href="http://keywordshitter.com/">Keyword Shitter</a></h3><p>Keyword Shitter, despite its obscene name, is awesome.</p><p>This one you need to see to understand. Take a look:</p><p>Put in some seed keywords, and it will SPEW out a collection of related, long-tail keyphrases real fast.</p><h3><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">AlchemyAPI</a></h3><p><strong>Okay, these keyword research tools are going to get a bit more advanced now</strong>, starting with AlchemyAPI.</p><p>AlchemyAPI, as the name implies is an awesome API that can be used for semantic SEO keyword research.</p><p>You can get a lot from just using their<a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo/alchemylanguage/">Demo page</a>.</p><p><a href="http://builtvisible.com/favourite-keyword-tools/">BuiltVisible</a>(formerly SEOGadget) even created this<a href="http://searchwilderness.com/downloads/AlchemyAPI.xlsm">awesome Excel macro</a>to use it with it.</p><h3><a href="http://www.knime.org/knime">Knime</a></h3><p>Knime is a modular data analytics, reporting, and workflow integration platform popular within the big data and machine learning communities.<em>(my best foot forward when it comes to explaining this thing).</em></p><p>It’s open source software and sports drag and drop nodes and has integration with everything from the Twitter and Google APIs to Python and R.</p><p>Now, the applications of Knime are pretty much endless, but lately, I’ve been using it specifically for keyword research. Let me explain…</p><p>For a while now, I’ve been interested in using social media for keyword research.</p><p>It’s my belief that the user wants to consume content that speaks there language, and there is no place better to mine natural language than social media.</p><p>At first I tried a premium tool called<a href="http://www.tellagence.com/tellagencediscover/">Tellagence Discover</a>, which I would totally recommend if you have the budget for it, and Knime is too daunting. What it does is pull in something like 200,000 tweets around a specified keyword and maps out relationship of other terms being using around it.</p><p>That’s essentially what I was able to create with Knime, but it does more. You input an XML Sitemap for your website.</p><p>Then you input the keyword you want to search on Twitter for, input the number of tweets to pull from Twitter, and select whether you want to examine only “popular tweets” or “recent tweets”.</p><p>Then it pulls in the text contents from the body of the webpages extracted form the XML sitemap using the<a href="https://www.readability.com/developers/api">Readability API</a>, calculates the frequency that they are mentioned, and pulls in search volume data from<a href="http://grepwords.com/">Grepwords</a>(not free).</p><p>It does the same thing for the Tweets.
