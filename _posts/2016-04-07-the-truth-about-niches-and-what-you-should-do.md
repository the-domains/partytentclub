Those of you that are freelancers, or owners of web design, SEO, marketing companies and the like, have probably heard conflicting advice about whether you should focus on a single niche or multiple niches.

****

I have no agenda here. I have no skin in the game whether you believe you should focus on one niche or multiple niches. It makes no difference to me, aside from the slight annoyance every time this debate comes up.

****

The only thing I want to do here, is clear the air because no matter which side of the argument you stand on, there's misconceptions attached.

****

In this post you will learn:

****

The benefits of focusing on one niche

The benefits of targeting multiple niches

Which position gives you the better chance at sales

Pros and Cons of both positions

How to better position your company for success!

So lets get to it.

DEFINING YOUR GOALS
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a68fd957-8eb9-4485-b87a-1b74dd585425.jpg)

****

To determine what is right for you and more beneficial for you, you first need to define your goals.

****

There is absolutely no sense in arguing which strategy is better until you first understand what your goals are and what you want your business to be.

****

Focusing on a single niche is very limiting, and not really a smart business move if all you want to do is work with local businesses. That's also without mentioning the fact you would be competing with yourself for any SEO or marketing work you're doing for the businesses in a niche you're focusing on.

****

So... before going any further, we have to decide what is it you want to do? Do you want to work with businesses locally? Do you want to work with businesses across the country?

****

Like I discuss in my Ultimate Blueprint To Start a Web Agency, there's two common approaches that seem to work well. You either work locally, with multiple business types or you work nationally, focusing on a niche... or you can work nationally, focusing on multiple niches while keeping your marketing campaigns more niche focused.

****

So to summarize you have 4 options in how you move forward:

****

Work with local businesses, no niche focus

Work with local businesses, in a specific niche

Work nationally, with no niche focus

Work nationally in a specific niche

BREAKING DOWN THE 4 OPTIONS

****

1.) WORKING WITH LOCAL BUSINESS WITH NO NICHE FOCUS

****

This is the option I see a lot of people sticking to. I personally am not a fan but it does have a position of strength.

****

I'm sure many of you that are cold calling to generate leads, have already heard from businesses owners rejecting you, saying that they would "rather deal with someone local", or "I spend my money on local businesses".

****

Working with local businesses gives you an advantage since you're there, you're local. You can go into their office, give a presentation, they can drive to your office, meet you at starbucks or wherever to discuss the project.

****

It's especially great for those of you with strong face to face or in person sales skills.

****

The downfall is pretty similar to the strength. You're local. That will typically come with a lot of wasted time in meetings, or "come to my office and show me how this works" and things along those lines.

****

If you're a timid person, you will get abused. You must set boundaries and expectations if you want to work exclusively with local businesses.

****

Another downfall is that your only specialization is within the location, but not a specific industry. The businesses you likely want to work with most, are businesses that are aggressive in their marketing and want to be the \#1 business in their field. Many times, the local factor isn't enough to win the sale, they want proven results within their industry because it is the lower risk and higher reward option.

2.) WORKING WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES IN A SPECIFIC NICHE

****

You have all the advantages that option 1 has, and focusing on a specific niche also eliminates one of the biggest weaknesses, in not making the sale due to lack of specialization.

****

That additional advantage, creates an extreme disadvantage as well, by limiting the amount of opportunity in your local area.

****

Perhaps you are in a large metropolitan area, and it's feasible that you can target metro cities, suburbs, etc. and have the potential for 50 or so clients. You're still very limited in growing your business.

****

While this may work for less competitive (in nature) services, like maybe web design, you won't be able to successfully offer SEO or marketing services due to a conflict of interest. This is a major problem and also why I don't consider this a viable option for anybody that's serious about making a living. 

****

3.) WORKING NATIONALLY IN A SPECIFIC NICHE

****

You lose the location advantage but for the businesses you really want to work with, you have the advantage of being specialized.

****

You have a portfolio, or existing clientele that proves you can get results and have successfully done so across the country for businesses like theirs.

****

Many business owners have friends in the same field, across the United States which can help you beef up your referral based sales, and sometimes your leads will also recognize some of the businesses in your portfolio. Instant trust builder right there!

****

Even if you don't have an existing client base, or portfolio, it isn't hard to get started when you focus on a niche. You can simply talk to business owners in the niche you want to target. Explain that you used to freelance for other agencies and now you're starting your own, but focused on their specific industry. Say it was the industry you were most familiar with when freelancing... in order to build your portfolio, you're cutting your prices in half to build references.

****

Pretty easy.

****

Now the trick to this option, is to understand that you can't go too broad in niche, but you also can't be too specific. You want a somewhat high ceiling for what your potential can be, otherwise the niche would be a waste of time.

****

A friend of mine had a company selling websites to people in the "pet industry"... this may have been a little too broad, but it worked well for him, selling websites to veterinarians, pet shops, groomers, rescue organizations, etc. He was doing about 650-800k/year in sales.

****

If you're going to focus on a specific niche, you probably want to be more specific than that. While he did generate a large amount in sales, it wasn't without a large sales team and large marketing budget.

****

A simple rule to help guide you:

****

The less money you have, the tighter the niche should be... while the more money you have, the broader the niche can be.

****

You also have to keep in mind that once your business is doing very well in that specific niche and you don't have much more room for growth due to limitations in the market, you can just as easily start another business under the same brand name to focus on a new niche.

****

4.) WORKING NATIONALLY WITH NO NICHE FOCUS

****

This is the option that gives you the broadest possible range of clients. There really is no limitation in what you can do or how big you can grow your business.

****

While you don't benefit from the advantages of a local focus, or a niche specific focus, you do benefit from the larger image you create for your company.

****

Sure... business owners can say, well I want to work with someone local. You can fire back, saying, " I understand that but keep in mind, local web designers or local SEO companies typically deal with local businesses. I deal with businesses across the country, I know what works and what doesn't work and I've been able to repeat \#1 rankings for different keywords, different businesses and different cities across the ENTIRE country".

****

This is the route that I chose when I started. Was it right? Maybe... maybe not.

****

However, I learned a lot of things along the way and there were always certain industries that would end up calling in wanting to buy, more than others. There were certain industries I decided to focus on with my "quadruple threat" marketing method, which by the way, was niche focused.

****

If you do decide to be more general on a national scale you have to be prepared to focus on specific niches in your marketing.

****

Certain times of the year I would have my sales people calling roofers, then landscapers, then concrete contractors, etc. If I had a sales person that had experience in a certain industry previously, like if they were a roofer or worked with a roofing company, they would call roofing companies exclusively.

****

Direct mail pieces would be created and customized for specific niches.

****

My email marketing, and the method I teach in "Ice Cold Email Gold" talks about segmenting your cold email list based on the niche.

****

If you go after a national clientele, without focusing on a specific niche, you need to at least make your marketing efforts niche focused.

****

SO WHICH OPTION IS THE BEST?

****

I've laid out some details, pros and cons of each option.

****

It's impossible for me or anyone else to tell you which one is the best. Like I said before, you have to define your goals. Actually, you need to define yourself and your company.

****

What's best for you, may not be best for someone else.

****

We can pretty much eliminate \#2, doing business locally within a certain niche is likely to be a very bad idea when you consider possible scale and growth, or lack thereof.

****

I personally would eliminate \#1, as being the local guy in my opinion is too limiting and not very fun.

Best doesn't equate to highest gross revenue. The best option, is one that you identified with what you want to accomplish. It's an individual decision, not a decision that can be determined by any collective.
