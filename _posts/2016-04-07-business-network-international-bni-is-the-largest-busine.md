Business Network International -- BNI -- is the largest business referral group in the world [according to the BNI website][1]

> _"With over 190,000 members in 7,300 plus chapters worldwide, BNI is the largest business networking organization in the world. In 2015 alone, BNI members generated millions of referrals resulting in over $9.3 billion in closed business worldwide."_

9.3 billion in closed business in 1 year...  And yes -- there's probably one in your area!

My name is MJ and I own a digital online marketing agency specializing in Web design, SEO and PPC management for small local service businesses. I'm a member of BNI.  Nathan of Income Bully is my coach and BNI is a strategy we discussed as part of my marketing plan (even though he wasn't a big believer!)

## EXACTLY WHAT IS BNI?

BNI is a networking group of professionals looking for more business through referral[s][2] and relationship building between its members.  They only allow 1 professional per business category -- 1 lawyer -- 1 insurance agent -- 1 marketing specialist etc.

My BNI group of 42 professionals meets every Thursday morning for breakfast at 6.30am until 8.30am.  The meetings have a set schedule.  An introduction and the goals of BNI, the presidents report, then each member gets a 60 second spotlight pitch all about your company and services.  Each week one member will deliver a 10-minute presentation to the group all about their business.  The last thing we do each meeting is tally up the referrals we have given and received and thank those people for closed business.

Well that doesn't sound fun at all -- right?  And all you get is a 60 second pitch? Pffttt....

I'm going to let you in on a secret...its not the meetings that are the powerful part of BNI!

**BNI is powerful and successful for many other reasons **

1. Networking with the same group of 42 pro's every week and building referral relationships
2. The other members become friends and really look out for each other -- referring business and providing opportunities
3. Due to the fact that there are many categories of professionals -- you will be exposed to and get to know many people that you would never normally get the chance to meet and interact with
4. When you go to a Chamber of Commerce meeting your BNI friends will be there -- so you will know and be introduced to a lot more people as an expert in marketing
5. Relationship marketing works really well for SEO -- having strong testimonials from your BNI friends cements you as a leader and authority in local business marketing, not some 'spammer might steal my money and do no work dude'!
6. If I asked my group for help -- I would have up to 42 -- 5\* Google reviews by tomorrow!
7. The 42 Pro's in my chapter give me access to 'expert' base of skills to lean on and utilize to help me grow my business.

**_Whatever Mj you BNI brainwashed -- secret cult -- secret handshake muppet!_**

**_All I really want to know is will it get me more Clients and Money???_**

Oh Hell Yeah!  I didn't join out of the kindness of my heart.

BNI is a great way to get clients in my experience.  You get the chance to position yourself as an authority locally.

LOOK: all you guys associated with Nathan and Income Bully know your stuff -- I read your posts on the Skype mastermind group -- you just need more exposure to those people most likely to hire you -- as well as at the fee schedule you want to charge...

## YOU MUST UNDERSTAND -- IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST AND AUTHORITY...
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/494b700d-f910-45ea-b767-42652d70ea30.jpg)

I'm going to outline step by step two of my [strategies to maximize the potential][3] of BNI membership for getting new prospects to do business with you.  Even if you only just joined and haven't yet become 'trusted' by the group, even if no one knows you and even if you are not a good networker...

My BNI chapter has 42 members; we are one of the biggest groups in our area.  Therefore it's almost impossible to meet, refer and be friends with everyone from the group when you initially join.  Nobody see's you as an authority or even trust you yet -- So here's what I did...

I built a circle of influence -- which is -- the members of my BNI group that are most likely to be able to make good referrals to my business -- as well as those I can find great referrals for.

My Circle Of Influence (COI) group is made up of the business consultant, business broker, financial adviser, lawyer, estate planner, computer shop owner, promotional marketing products store as well as the computer tech guy.  They deal with local clients and a lot of those clients are small businesses that need your help.  Their clients 'need' the online marketing services that we provide.  Every member of my circle of influence has the same customer -- but we all offer different services.

**See the potential here?**

All I did was approach them during a 1-2-1 meeting and pitched my COI group idea.  They all jumped at the chance...we meet outside of BNI one evening a week.  Its not mandatory attendance, we are informal.  Usually we all sit around a big conference table, strategize and drink beer!   We learn about each other and the ideal type of referral we want -- we share clients.  It is very powerful...trust me!

Strategy 2....

## I DO NOT DO FREE CONSULTS... I DO_WORKSHOPS_

__

People LOVE to go to workshops -- but they don't show up nearly as well for a lecture or a pitch!

When I became a BNI member I decided that I wanted to do something cool, useful and profitable to get maximum exposure to my BNI group. These workshop classes I run for small, invite only, groups of BNI members or people referred to me by a circle of influence friend...

6-8 people max... I help them and we actually do a lot of work...they see the value and how good I am -- I have gotten lots of business from doing this... As we work, I get to chat about PPC and SEO, and the [VALUE of rankings and a website that converts well.][4]

So right now you are saying to yourself -- "but I don't have a conference room" -- right?

Me either!  I borrow one from the computer store guy ...

I referred a big client to the computer store guy, he is also in my COI -- so to say thanks he let's me use his deluxe super lush 12 seat high back leather chair conference room anytime I want it after 5pm Monday through Friday.

No computer store guy in your area with a conference room?  Try the lawyers and accountants -- they always have conference room...Worst-case scenario -- Google Executive Suites {Your City} and you can rent a fully equipped conference room for under $50...

**I did this strategically -- here's my system:**

The first time I went as a guest, I Googled BNI {My City} and found the chapter I was attending the next day.  The website gives you all the info you need to grind down and do some research.  I picked 2 people.  1 of them I knew years ago, the computer store guy, the other was a lawyer.  I looked at their online presence, ran a competitive analysis and found out their rankings, looked at their FB page, G+ local listings ranking -- all the normal stuff you do to research a prospect.  Figured out what I could fix easily and compiled that info and printed it out.

Then I met them the next day.  I'd already decided to join this group.  I pitched the 2 guys as I handed in my membership application...my 'fee' was use of their conference room, and the both took me up on it...

**NOTE:**You can only go as a guest, twice, to any 1 chapter, so in my area there are 3 chapters, I could attend 6 meetings...Every chapter loves getting new people in, simply email the President shown on the BNI website and you can go as a guest this week...

Simple huh -- then all I did was during the 2ndweek of my membership after I had met a few people, I just started inviting them to my workshops.  I did one class the first week, 1 the next, 2 the week after that -- I have 2 planned per week for the next 3 weeks, one workshop during working hours and one in the evenings.  It's been such a success and created an amazing buzz that I now get emails from people asking (begging!) to come to my workshop...

Last week I got an invitation to talk to a group of 14 Insurance agents, this was a referral from a past workshop attendee...

Do you see that I'm talking to my ideal prospects?  They already know and trust me.  The past workshops have made me the trusted authority on Digital marketing...

The workshop is scheduled for an hour and basically we usually run to 2 hours -- I help them with something simple like their Google maps pageor I show them my Google 5\* review system -- "get more 5\* Google reviews in the next 30 days than you got all last year" -- I send them a checklist of stuff before the class to have on their computer, images, passwords, logins to their accounts and then I just start showing them some simple things.

We work through creating the G+ profiles, adding the images and doing the descriptions.  I start totalk about citations,I run a quick audit for those in the workshop to find duplicates and incorrect listings online.  I hand them the printouts.

Do you think they will go home and do it themselves?  No -- they won't...

I educate them on why they should hire me and why they need to refer me to their friends...We actually do work in the workshop and build something for them...I like building out the G+ maps page as it leads into selling each one of the attendees a monthly maps ranking service as well as our other services we can sell them.  This week I'm doing a social profile creation and social stacking workshop...Not sure yet what service I'm going to pitch them -- but it was requested by 9 members of my BNI group, so I figured -- whatever -- it's cool...I like teaching!!

I always make a group pitch at the end of the workshop.  I say something like -- I hope you got great value this evening.  Now we really need to start working on properly optimizing your Local G+ maps listing, geo tagging the images and creating or fixing the citations.  For the people in this room -- ONLY -- I will fully optimize and SEO your G+ page for a one time fee of $750 -- I normally charge $1000 and if you want me to continue with a monthly service getting a top 3 listing it will be $300 a month recurring.  I have not had a class yet that I didn't get at least 1 client...

That's the only 'free' consults I ever do...

Do you see what just happened -- this 'new member' just became the trusted local authority!

Truthfully -- the first workshop I did, I didn't know if I would have much to say, honestly I was really nervous -- but see, guys like you and I -- we know a million percent more than the regular business owner...you don't need to be a SEO ninja -- you just need to know more than the regular business owner!

It was way easier than my fevered imagination told me it was going to be the night before!!  We got into a cool Q&A on SEO, website conversion optimization and G+ Local listings being so important...

These sessions are fun too -- especially when the workshop finishes and usually at least 2 or 3 of them want to talk about signing up for local SEO, PPC management or a new website.

It's a system that works if you work it...

**LOOK:**we are all a lot alike here in Income Bully -- solo practitioners with a bit of freelance help.  Personally -- Id rather find great jobs through referral with the type of clients that will pay good money -- instead of spreading myself thin on the crappy clients that are all talk and little to no money...

I don't want to work my ass off for no money -- grinding out endless hours in front of the computer for a few hundred bucks...Hell No -- I want to build a real business that has lots of recurring income!

**BNI MEMBERSHIP PRICES**-- it's not expensive -- there's a joining fee of about $140 and a yearly dues of $450 or so depending on the chapter...but consider this -- Thursday morning I'm having a 1 1/2hr breakfast with 42 professionals.  I made my money back 10X within 2 weeks of being a member -- Heck -- I made $1200 before they even made me a member!  So I paid the $590 to join -- it's worth it just to try -- but the more you put into the system the more you get out of it.

**[Never miss an opportunity to grow your knowledge and skill set, join over 1,000 other people making money using this information by entering your email here][4]**

## A WORD OF WARNING

People will NOT fall all over themselves to throw money at you -- but if you show and share knowledge, demonstrate your ability and generally just be helpful -- then start building yourself a core group of those most likely to refer you (COI) you will make a lot of sales, easily and at top dollar...

Last week -- I closed a project running a local political ad campaign for a member of my BNI group -- chatted with another prospect and closed writing an auto-responder series for a local car dealer -- then get into their SEO and look at their paid ad campaign, yes and we want to do Facebook as well!!!

They already TRUST me so the sale was simple!  They need it done and they are going hire me...

This week was even better, I've closed 4 G+ local maps monthly ranking accounts, 2 complete website builds, 3 SEO accounts -- oh yeah -- and the Chiropractor's SEO account while I was writing this blog post!!

These BNI groups -- the people in them have really become my good friends -- we look out for each other...BUT you have got to find referrals for them as well -- that's they way it works...

It's not hard to find referrals for your friends -- the more you network the more opportunities to refer your close circle...The computer tech guy in our group -- I get him to do all my client email installs, fixes any software issues they have, I don't want to do that crap! -- he can work remotely, yeah sure he's more expensive but why would I care, his customer base is all small local businesses -- you think he can make a few referrals....yeah he refers -- because he knows me, trusts me and knows his client will be pleased with what I can do -- so everyone is happy...

You just need to keep your ear to the ground for referral opportunities -- they are there if you're listening...

## THE NEXT STEPS

Visit a few groups, choose one -- instead of looking for certain people, look at their industries, the computer repair shop guy, the computer tech, business coaches, business lawyers -- these are a goldmine for our web design and SEO business...AND you are a goldmine referrer for them too -- [we have the same clients but we are not in competition][4]...Re read the bit about setting up outlook email and fixing computer bugs or installing anti-virus software -- blah -- nah...I pass on that job -- but I have a guy that I trust and hire regularly to do it for all my clients -- I have his number right here for you!

When you visit a chapter look at their income and referrals sheets -- they hand them out at every meeting, even if you are a visitor you get to see them -- my chapter has referred over $700K in closed business so far this year -- over $200K a month -- 42 members -- you do the math ... Go get yourself a piece

Visit a couple of different chapters -- you can visit 2 times as a visitor per chapter -- just Google BNI + Your City -- the members are all listed online...Do a bit of research...your category is Online Marketing -- they can have a web designer -- you can still get in as a SEO expert -- but BNI is one pro per category only -- that protects you.

**The Commitment**-- you have got to attend every week -- my group meets every Thursday morning.  6.30-7am Networking -- 7 -- 8.30am meeting -- 8.30-? Networking...3 absences max per 6 months -- you are allowed 3 substitutes to take your place.

**The Membership Fee:**Pffttt -- In comparison to what you get -- it's nothing...

**Membership Process:**You apply then have an interview with the membership committee -- you provide 2 references that they will check -- they make a decision.  More than anything they want you to be active, in business, make sure the other members like you, that your category is open and let you know the financial and time commitment required.  They also want to know you will refer and network.  There's a training session -- 3 hours -- no biggie, it was actually fun, back to basics sales 101 and networking skills.

## THE BNI VOODOO DOLL

Nah -- there's no secret handshake, no BNI brainwashing (although we do have a hypnotherapist in our group...hmmmm!) its not like that -- the members are local business owners just like you and I, they want more work and they believe in networking and referring -- otherwise it just wouldn't work...

I think some people get the wrong idea about BNI because of some of the people.  True -- our group has some old-timers; they are set in their ways and a bit gruff!  But man oh man -- they have a ton of connections and experience.  One guy in my group barely talks to anyone -- old miserable bugger...He called me the other day -- I'll tell you that story in a minute...

**Overall:**I like BNI -- we have a great group -- it works for me and I have gotten a ton of business from it.  I have been a member less than 2 months.  Last week I ran 6 appointments and 'decided' to take on 3 SEO jobs -- and 1 FB Ad Campaign.  The other 2 jobs were web re-designs, which I hate, not a complete re- design but change this and that BS...not much money -- so I didn't take the work...

I have more consults to run next week that are 'money' jobs doing SEO on a couple of big projects, as well as an auto responder system to build...

I met a guy for breakfast the other morning -- owner of a massive company that is friends with the mean old grumpy BNI member of my group.  Anyway, this guy has a huge SEO project needed for his company.  Can you see there's no pipeline for me to struggle through?  Most of you would never get a chance to talk to this guy -- not from doing online marketing...this kind of guy is not clicking a Facebook sponsored post or answering a cold call!

He takes advice from people he trusts -- It's not going to be you and 10 others bidding on his stuff...

The mean old grumpster was chatting with him at the golf club, told the guy what a nice polite young man I am and how I'd been blowing the group away with my help and knowledge.  He dialed my number and put me on speakerphone...Meeting set!

I met with the business owner, told him who I am and what I do -- then I told him what I believe he needs based on my research  -- he made a decision and wrote the check there and then. There's no waiting period ...I'm speaking to the decision maker...He's wearing a $20K watch and driving a $100K car...He doesn't flinch when you give him your price!

I'm busy -- lots more work in the pipeline as well.  It's about the best ROI in time and money I have spent in this SEO/PPC business -- but the biggest part is that it opened me up to being out there, doing tons of cool stuff like the workshops and being able to get a bit picky with who I take on as a client...

BNI is just[one 'part' of a successful marketing strategy][4] for a digital marketing agency.  I know you want to build a massive Agency and never see anyone -- speak to anyone and you don't care if you get local clients...well buddy -- you damn well should care...Get those local clients -- build your portfolio -- go get that money...its laying there waiting for you to pick it up -- you just have to scoop it up!

I have been doing really well with BNI -- closing sales and making money...BUT -- as my dear ol' coach Nathan said "didn't you send out postcards and direct mail yet? -- Wow don't go getting lazy..."

So the letters and postcards are now at the printers Nathan...

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Check out Nate's Niche list below -- scan through it because a lot of those Niches will be represented in your BNI group.  Make notes of those industries that have 'lookalike' clients to you.   Which industries would be servicing and selling to small business owners -- just like your clients?  That's your Circle Of influence group.

Which local service industries (plumber, electrician, landscaper, insurance agent, lawyer etc) are represented...these are your prospects...

Then jump onto the BNI website (Google -- BNI {my city}) and see which of those niches are represented.  Email or call the Chapter president and go attend a meeting or two.  They will welcome you in; they will try to get you to submit an application for membership...Brainwashing is optional...

**LOOK:**Just do it...go out and get to shaking hands and meeting the type of people that 'need' your services...

I'm sure you can think of good reasons not to try this -- maybe $590 is too much money for you -- but really -- it's an investment...You can keep fooling around, all shiny object eyes -- chasing the next guru promise...OR -- you can go meet and greet, talk to prospects and turn them into clients...

And if it's not BNI -- do something -- anything -- I don't care if it's email, craigslist, postcards, thumbtack -- whatever -- quit procrastinating and telling everyone 'by the end of this year' bullshit...The time will NEVER be perfect...So -- the best time to start is now...

You already know 'way' more than the average business owner -- You already have learned a ton of tricks that can help them... NOW -- your time is NOW...

**NOW -- Get out there and CLOSE those deals!!**
