There's a few things you need to know about running an agency.

It IS fun, for the most part and there are few things better in life than being your own boss.

Before you head down the road to success or make a turn onto the boulevard of broken dreams, here are a few tips that will help.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO GET STARTED

There are a few things you need to keep in mind before giving this the good ole "college try".

### 1.) IT'S MUCH EASIER TO MAKE MONEY WHEN YOU HAVE MONEY

It seems pretty basic.

It seems obvious.

Why is it that half the people wanting to get started in this field are broke? They have no money to invest in their business, they have no money to invest in themselves.

If you can't afford your own web hosting or a domain name then you're in trouble.

If you can't afford a phone line so you can cold call or simply accept calls from clients, then you're setting yourself up for failure.

Most people can not start something from nothing. It's just not likely to happen. The few people that CAN, still end up failing. Does that seem like a logical risk to take?

I actually was one of those people that started with pretty much nothing. Leeching wifi from a business nearby. It's not fun and it's extremely difficult to be able to make money when you have nothing to invest.

The best advice I can give you, is get a job. Have a little bit of money saved up so you can afford to start things the right way. It's so much easier to make money when you already have money.

Money, isn't the end goal. Money is just a very important tool. Building a business without it is like trying to build a house from the ground up, using a steak knife to cut wood and a rock to pound nails in... instead of a hammer.

**You want to succeed? Don't work for money... make your money work for you.**

### 2.) YOU NEED A FREAKIN PLAN!

Just wanting to do something, isn't enough.

Do you have a business plan? A marketing plan? Do you have benchmarks setup so you can put money aside for future expenses in order to grow your business?

Do you have outsourcers lined up? Project management platform?

Do you know who your ideal customer is?

Do you know what your pricing strategy is or are you just going to "custom quote" everything?

These are all things you should have covered. You should have every aspect of your business, planned out ahead of time. Remember, this isn't just money you're investing but your time. Don't you want to make the most of your investment?

Before you decide to get into this, set some time aside to really come up with a plan.

### 3.) JUST DO IT!

Making your money work for you, having an actual plan you can execute... neither one of these things really make much of a difference if you're the type to just sit back and look for excuses to why you're not putting things into motion.

"Take action", is what most people say to do, and you'll be fine. Not exactly the truth though is it? However, when you have an actual plan then you can take highly focused action, which is what matters.

Are you worried about calling someone and interrupting their day? Just do it... Thinking about when you should start your own blog, just do it and then figure out a launch date.

People get hung up on stupid stuff. I'm no exception and I'm sure you aren't either.

There comes a point when the planning phase is done. Don't procrastinate by adding unnecessary things to your plan, just get started implementing it!
