  Obviously, collisions are bad for the deer, but they they can also be
  devastating for humans.Also, deer are not the only animals that can cause
  collisions. Depending on where you live, you may need to watch out for
  raccoons, turkeys, and groundhogs.











  On a daily basis we seem to see some advert from yet another fuel company
  claiming that its fuel will leave your engine deposit-free whilst delivering
  increased fuel efficiency.

  This got me to thinking and, in a quiet moment, I decided to have a trawl
  around the internet to see what other people were suggesting to aid with saving
  fuel; there were a lot of tips and ideas, ranging from the absurd to the
  ingenious. In reality though, there were just a few tips that made sense and
  were practical enough to make them suitable for the everyday motorist.
