It's 2016... Technology is advancing, Google is getting more and more complex for many, Mobile usage is up and there are no signs of these things stopping. While businesses may be more willing when it comes to getting into the digital realm and expanding their marketing budgets; consultants and agencies are still using more traditional, "old school" methods.

****

Do you know why these methods are still used?

****

It's not because they're fun. People that say they love cold calling are usually lying... It's not fun and it's not the most fulfilling line of work.

****

It's used because it works. Is it the best technique? I'll leave that for others to discuss but there is no denying the fact that telemarketing works, and generates revenue for [small time companies, individual consultants and big, Fortune 500 mammoth companies.][1]

****

So for all you readers planning to hit the phones to "drum up business", here's 8 tips to help you along the way.

8 COLD CALLING TIPS FOR 2016 AND BEYOND!

****

1.) AUTOMATE YOUR DATA COLLECTION AND SCRAPE THOSE LEADS!

****

Yeah, you can use a phone book, you can also just Google different businesses and call them on the spot, but it isn't efficient. Your lead or prospect data should be collected before you're ready to pick up the phone and trade in those dials for dollars.

****

I've been recommending Mobile Renegade for a long time, that automatically scrapes data with the Yellow Pages and YellowBook, plus there's additional plugins to scrape other sources (you can see it in action here). However, it isn't necessary you use that software, there's countless different pieces of software that can essentially do the same thing with other sources. You can also use a lead service like InfoFree or have a VA scrape for you.

****

The point is, you want the data to be available with a few clicks. You don't want to waste time with searches every couple minutes so you can call the next number.

****

2.) THROW OUT THE SCRIPT AND BE AUTHENTIC!

****

I don't care what the sales gurus tell you. A script often times causes more harm than good.

****

If you're trying tostart your own agencyor if you have an existing agency...hell, if you're a business owner of any kind, you should know enough about what you do and offer that you don't need to read off a piece of paper in front of you.

****

A couple of hours ago, I watched this horrendous video of a guy that was bragging about setting up an appointment. He was reading from a script, and it sounded absolutely awful. I predict that the business owner that agreed to the appointment, probably never showed up or allowed him to talk to him when appointment time came.

****

When sales trainers, gurus, teachers, etc. tell you to use a script, it sounds like something that makes sense. Some of those teachers are very good and walk the walk in real life, not just behind a computer, but the reality is that if they aren't listening to you and there with you, they will never be able to help you adjust your delivery and tailor the script to your specific personality, voice and tone.

****

You can prepare yourself for calls, have an idea of what you're going to say, especially to get past the gatekeeper, but understand that the point of the call is to have a conversation with the business owner. Scripts aren't made for conversations. Scripts are made to eliminate thought so larger companies with telemarketers don't have problems with people trying to "make their own script", usually for insurance and liability reasons.

****

Are you a quiet person? Then call as a quiet, polite person. Are you loud and obnoxious? Then be that way on the phone. Be yourself. Do you live your life reading off a script? No... leave that for professional actors.

3.) CALL FOR SALES NOT APPOINTMENTS
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/82135af3-b22e-42cc-8327-9aa7d7aa46ad.jpg)

****

This one really gets under my skin.

****

Look... if you want to work locally, that's fine. Call for an appointment if you feel much more confident face to face instead of over the phone. Personally, even if it's local I would rather call for the sale, instead of having to meet.

****

Now, for some reason there's people out there suggesting that when you cold call across your state or the entire country, you should call and get the person interested, and setup an appointment. A phone appointment or phone consultation is also what some people do.

****

The problem is quite simple, you're just adding an additional touching point in order to get a sale. Sales don't need to be made on the first call but if you want to be successful cold calling, you need to make sure sales are your focus, and NOT appointments.

****

Unless you're traveling and doing the face to face or door to door thing, forget the appointments. Don't ask for them, don't give people them, don't allow anyone to tell you to setup appointments when you already have an interested business owner on the phone. No... it won't build up suspense, it just builds up opportunity for life to happen and the interest to drop.

****

Remember... keep it simple. Don't let people complicate things.

****

Think about it, what sounds easier?

****

Cold call, get someone interested in what you off, sell them the idea of scheduling an appointment, go to the appointment, hope they're still available, then SELL to them on the appointment...... OR....... Cold Call, get someone interested, sell what you're offering?

****

I think the latter is ideal.

****

4.) DLL -- DON'T LOSE LEADS.... EVER
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4fc5d9d3-4260-44b3-bdf5-7d7060cfac12.jpg)

****

This isn't just a beginner's tip. It's a tip for those of you that are more experienced and have been successfully cold calling. It's time to close out your excel files and hit the "X" on notepad. I'm sorry... It's time.

****

There's countless CRMs out there that allow you to effectively track your leads, keep notes, set reminders on when to call and they also allow you to visualize your data so you can see your conversions, win rate, loss rate, data to dump rate, sales in your funnel, funnel value, sales forecasting, etc.

****

I likeNutshell CRM, I've been using it for years now and they continue to develop a very strong platform that's suitable for most people's needs without the crazy complications other platforms tend to have. It costs money, but there's other options out there that are free, like a self hosted VTiger, or you can go with insightly, or of course Salesforce.

****

You need an efficient way to track your leads and also see data within a couple clicks.

****

5.) ALWAYS FOLLOW UP AND ALWAYS NURTURE YOUR LEADS!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/358eb4c0-655d-47ed-b608-eaf1cf975845.jpg)

****

Everyone that's been in sales understands that not all leads are ready to buy when you first talk to them.

****

They express interest, but they want more information. They receive the information and now they have questions, then they need more information so they start researching, and this is the point where many companies lose out on business because they weren't directing their research.

****

In 2015, I wrote theUltimate Guide To Lead Nurturing, because this is an area that is rarely talked about among marketers and bloggers. Some of the Inbound blogs like Hubspot will discuss it but usually surface level stuff that doesn't really help.

****

Let me put it this way... If you are investing the time, in doing something so remedial like cold calling, you better make sure you come up with a lead nurturing plan so you don't let those leads bounce out of your funnel. You need to educate them. You need to direct them to YOUR OWN content that helps them make decisions and helps them answer questions.

****

You also need to understand that you will have to continue to follow up with your leads. Lead nurturing and following up are NOT the same things.

****

I've lost a lot of sales and I've had sales people lose a lot of sales due to "unlucky" periods of time in between following up. Every time you make a follow up call, you should want to make a sale. If they're not ready, then you need to tell them you will follow up with them in X days or X weeks, is that okay? Usually they will say yes. If they say no, then they aren't an active lead anymore.

****

To summarize: Remember that you need to follow up with your leads. Never rely on them to call you when they're ready to do business, you have to call them. Also, develop a lead nurturing plan, it will come in handy, allowing you to close more sales and also save "lost leads" that have turned cold or inactive.

****

6.) IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF YOUR SALES CYCLE

****

A lot of people think in black and white terms. You call, you get someone interested and now they're a lead... 1 month later, they still haven't purchased from you... you think they aren't interested anymore so you stop with your follow up calls and move on. The cycle then repeats.

****

Specifically in the web design, SEO, ORM, and digital marketing business, your average sales cycle can be longer than what you think is ideal.

****

You're not selling newspaper subscriptions for $2/week. You're not selling those delicious mint girl scout cookies everybody loves for $5/box. You're selling a larger one time service/fee or a larger monthly commitment, right?

****

Sometimes these sales take a long time. Maybe you will never get a one call close with these services, it's possible, but maybe it isn't likely for you.

****

Guess what? It's okay...

****

Marketers tend to brag about their victories, and many times exaggerate what they've accomplished. The reality of this business is that depending on your level of skill, and what marketing methods you're using, your average sales cycle can be between 5 days and 5 months.

****

With cold calling, most sales people I had working for me were averaging about a 21 day sales cycle... some were better, some were much worse. In fact, a lot of sales came in after month 3 and 4\.

****

This is why it is important to understand the different stages of the sales cycle.

****

1.) They have interest and they know the cost

2.) They have an idea of what they want, and have seen your work

3.) They've committed to a "package" or "quote" you've given them

4.) They've said they will be ready to get started on X date

5.) They Pay

****

There's a guy that made calls for me... it didn't matter if the lead was at the "having interest and knowing the cost" stage, he would make his follow up call and ask if they're ready to buy, completely ignoring where the lead was in the sales process. It didn't go very well for him.

****

What a lot of people don'tdiscuss about cold calling, is the fact you need to have a certain level of awareness. If you aren't aware of where the lead is in your cycle, you have big problems!

****

7.) IGNORE THE TYPICAL SALES GURU HYPE

****

We've all seen Wolf of Wall Street. I forget all the other common movies that get clipped for telemarketing motivation.

****

I'd much rather watch Don Draper's Mad Men magic in the boardroom where he sells ideas with authority, smoothness and pure confidence, instead of the scripted, superficial energy that the typical business owner despises... and since I referenced it, I must include it:

**

<iframe width="600" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5y4b-DEkIps" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" style=""></iframe>

**

****

There's a lot of advice out there, much of it being very bad.

****

Don't talk in a higher tone of voice to sound more energetic. If you're a man, you'll sound like a girly man and no businessman wants to buy something from a girly man.

****

Don't pay $$$'s for a "guru script".

****

Chances are you aren't going to find a secret sauce in some course.

****

Sales gurus know that the advice they give, often times doesn't make a difference. The biggest difference maker is probably your attitude/confidence in yourself along with taking actual action.

****

8.) IF YOU LIVE BY THE PHONE... YOU DIE BY THE PHONE

****

What I mean by this is that you shouldn't be using telemarketing or cold calling as your only strategy in creating revenue for yourself and your company. It's a bad idea.

****

I've already covered many times, why ONLY focusing on cold calling can hinder you because the second you stop calling, is the second you stop generating leads, and in turn, revenue.

****

Smart diversification is always necessary when running a business, but it isn't just about diversifying for preservation, it's about implementing marketing and client acquisition techniques that provide a cumulative result, and exponential growth.

****

Cold calling for some reason continues to attract people even if they don't have the right personality or "will power" to do it consistently. It's NOT the right option for all people, all the time. I wish others would admit that.

****

However, it does work, and it can be a daunting task. Hopefully these tips will help you achieve more success in 2016!
