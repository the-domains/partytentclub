Okay, that might be a bit harsh... maybe SEO isn't dead, but things have changed and you need to look beyond SEO to drive traffic to your website.

If you put all your eggs in Google's basket by focusing only on SEO to generate traffic for your SaaS app, you could end up with much less traffic -- especially quality, qualified, relevant traffic -- than you'd like, which means fewer trial signups, fewer customers, and less revenue!

But don't worry... there are plenty of other ways to drive traffic to your website besides SEO and I've put a list together just for you...

So the times are changing, and when it comes to attracting the right crowd to the marketing site for your SaaS app, you need to embrace these changes.

## Rise of the Growth Hacker: Drive Traffic to your Website in creative ways

In fact, there's even a new ethos that has taken hold in Silicon Valley -- that of the 'Growth Hacker' -- and if you aren't familiar with the term,[Andrew Chen wrote a great piece][0] and said "Growth Hacker is the new VP Marketing."

Andrew even proclaims "_No traditional marketer would have figured this out_" when talking about Airbnb's super-slick Craigslist integration.

This is why Marketing VPs everywhere this year quickly changed their business cards and LinkedIn profiles to "Growth Hacker" because, c'mon, it's just too darn sexy to pass up...

... and no one wants to be thought of as a "traditional" marketer!

In today's world (vs. yesterday's or tomorrow's), that action starts by thinking outside the proverbial box...

...doing things that move your company forward in leaps and bounds -- often with some type of Viral Expansion Loop -- that are different from what everyone else is doing.

Even more, it means_**REALLY**_knowing your audience (target market) and doing things to get them to take action and get invested in your product.

## Leverage Growth Hacking and Viral Expansion Loops to drive traffic to your website

For Airbnb, it was finding a super cool integration that would add virality to their product_**AND**_additional exposure for their users' properties.

Another example is[HitTail][1]-- an SEO keyword tool -- where this "growth hacking" (knowing your customers and doing awesome things to reach/help them) resulted in the discovery that customers churned out because they got great SEO data, but didn't have time to write content around it...

... so HitTail is doing an integration with[Textbroker's API][2]to allow HitTail customers to order articles/blog posts on-demand based on keyword data!

## But You Just Need to Drive More Traffic to your Website, right?

But the truth is that, while these integrations are cool and can help a lot, there's a more basic complaint I still hear time and again and that is "_We need more traffic!_"

Well, traffic is something any Growth Hacker worth their salt should be able to get in droves, right?

But not just any traffic will do!

A successful sales process for your SaaS app starts by attracting the right audience...

... which is why I put together a presentation called "Traffic Hacking: 43 ways to get quality prospects to your site" to help you become the Growth Hacker I know you can be.

Look, attracting the Right Audience in the form of a steady (or steadily increasing) flow of relevant traffic to your marketing website is absolutely**_required_**for the scalable and sustainable growth of your SaaS or Web App company...

...and this one hour and 20-minute video presentation is pure, unadulterated traffic-getting awesomeness that will help you achieve that!

## SaaS Providers: How to Drive Traffic to Your Website

_**WARNING**_

: Before you spend a lot of time or money getting traffic to your site, make sure the site -- and your app -- are designed to engage and convert; otherwise you're wasting effort & money!

Okay, now...  because my presentation is so awesome (IMHO) -- seriously, it's 80-minutes jam-packed with a ton of my secrets that I've only ever shared with my clients -- I want to keep it a little bit secret still... just between you and me.

So here's what you need to do to boost the traffic to your SaaS marketing site:

1\.[Download and enjoy the slides][3] from the presentation (PDF) -- 54 slides of Traffic Generating awesomeness -- or you can check them out on Slideshare (below):

2\. Then watch the 80-minute presentation, but please note that since I presented this back in May 2012 I've updated the slide deck a few times -- and yes, I fixed the Pinterest spelling error (as well as a few others).

3\. Profit. (No guarantees, of course... but this_should_help)

For immediate consultation and advice on optimizing your marketing strategy -- including ways to drive traffic to your site, schedule at least a 15-minute meeting with me[via Clarity][4]. If you feel a more involved engagement is required for me to help you,[email me][5]with the specifics of your situation (as much detail as you're comfortable giving) and we'll setup a meeting to work through the particulars.

Since I'm taking off this week, heading over to Lithuania, Austria, and Denmark, I wanted to leave you with some homework, showing you how to get traffic to a new website.

Summer school is in.

I asked Rick Porter to give you the 3 most important things you should do when setting up a new site.

Now even if you have well-established sites, it's possible you've neglected these first steps.

And when you put Rick's tips to work, you should get more traffic -- without spending any money or doing affiliate deals.

Over to you Rick...

**3 Things You Must Do When Starting A Website**

By Rick Porter

In the last 2 years I've put up nearly 200 websites testing different site structures, templates, and linking strategies.

With that I have been able to analyze a lot of data and come to some simple practices I use when setting up blogs.

Here are a few steps and recommendations you can take to get a strong start with your site.  
**1) Use an SEO-friendly WordPress template**

The simple theme I prefer to use is called Heatmap Theme because it has been setup by the developer with SEO and internet marketing in mind.

It is a clean theme that is very scalable. You can put banners and widgets just about anywhere on the sidebars, footers, and in content of articles.

It is also a great theme to use for monetization and blogging.

There is a free version you can download and a paid version for only $70, well worth the investment. You can check out the site for more details on the bells and whistles you get with the paid version.

**2) Add the right content to your new site**

It's important you start off with outstanding content that sets you up as an authority for your topic.

Remember, the web has been cranking for over a decade now and there might be tens of millions of articles on your topics.

So here is a really easy way to set yourself apart from the crowd right away...

**MEGA TIP \#1: Create articles with over 1,000 words**.

That might seem long but when you see how many millions of short, spammy 200 to 300 word articles are out there on the internet you'll quickly see why Google values longer content.

I can get on page 1 for just about any keyword within a week as long as I have a few articles between 1000-1500 words.

Google rewards that.

If long content is too much work then you need to find someone to write it for you.

Fortunately, all of your articles don't need to be that long.

For your main keywords that have a LOT of competition, you'll need longer articles.

For long-tail, low competition keywords you can have 500 to  
800 word articles that link back into the longer articles.

**MEGA TIP \#2:**  
To create a really strong website that gets lots of SEO traffic, you want great content that interlinks together creating a great user experience.

To get an idea of what Google considers a "good user experience", take a look at some Wikipedia entries.

It's a clean menu, not cluttered with advertisements, and when you are reading an article it is packed with words that link to other articles.

For example, say you are reading an article on 'bodyweight exercises'. Where it mentions 'squats', there will be a link from 'squats' to a separate new page devoted entirely to the squat exercise.

This 'inter-linking' between articles on your site is the best way for the user to flow naturally from article to article gathering all the information they need.

Google likes that set-up.

It's up to you how deep you want to go with the information.

Wikipedia was a genius idea because the information proliferates on it's own as users add more pages to the site.

It would have been impossible for one blogger to create it.

**NOTE**: It doesn't matter if the information is 100% accurate or 'the best content' because Google has not yet become self aware with the ability to think and make decisions at that level...but give it a few more years and Skynet, I mean Google, will probably be judging articles.

**BOTTOM LINE:**

Small sites with 8-10 long articles can produce steady traffic, but it's good to put up a new article once every 2-3 weeks to continue to promote the blog.  0

Keep it alive and the traffic will keep coming.

Make sure your most important keywords can be quickly and easily clicked. If it takes several clicks to find an article then Google will give it low importance.

Google judges the importance of that article and keyword by how quickly it can get to it from its search spiders.

**3) Promote your site and get it indexed in Google**

I recommend surrounding your site with a social media prescience. Those are some of the easiest back-links to get and they come from high authority sites (i.e. Youtube).

Set up accounts on the following sites and create a complete profile and a link back to your site.

Youtube -- Create a profile, put your links, upload a couple videos about your niche.

Twitter -- Set up your blog with a plugin to automatically tweet all of your posts.

Facebook -- Set up a profile. Be detailed and make it unique so it has content about your niche. Add links to your site.

Blogger/Google -- Create a Google profile. It  must be over 100 words or they will not index your profile.

This goes for all profiles out there. If you simply put your name and a link there really isn't anything unique there that Google will find value to index, which means your back-link will not be indexed and counted.

Linkedin -- Set up a profile. Be detailed and make it unique so it has content about your niche. Add links to your site.

\*\***There are many many mor**e....

You can make things easier by creating a simple automatic syndication system.

Set up an account on Ping.fm, PixelPipe, Hellotext, and Status.net

These services allow you to integrate all of your social media accounts into one place so that when you write a new post it automatically goes out to all of them.

Either spend a couple hours setting up all these accounts, or find someone on Fivvr or Elance to do it for you.

This step is very important. You must do everything possible to set yourself up as a real person on the web to give your blog authority.  All these sites will give you a good backlink, and it's better to get 100 good high PR backlinks right away then tens of thousands of junk backlinks.

**BONUS Tip**

Submit your RSS feed to as many directories as possible.

Your content will be picked up in news feeds and syndicated.

If you have links in your content you will find you are getting free backlinks from this syndication.

So always make sure to have links in your article that point to other pages on your site.

**In Conclusion**:

There is so much to do when starting off a new site, but these are some simple things to get going so that you have a clean blog with an automatic syndication system.

I'll return with a blog post written in English on Wednesday.

But seriously, this info will save you 6 months to a year (or  
more) of struggling and trying to get traffic to your site.

Just print this and give it to an 8-year old kid, they'll figure it out.

To your success,
